# Danganronpa-Script-Dumps

Files containing dumped .lin file contents from the US/English PC ports of Danganronpa 1 and 2,

A personal forked version of [Danganronpa Tools](https://github.com/vn-tools/danganronpa-tools) was used to dump these.

[Personal fork of Danganronpa Tools](https://github.com/morgana-x/danganronpa-lin-compiler-v2) used in these dumps 

# Notice!
Please only use these files for reference when modding and finding out which files contain which text / event

Use CTRL + F to search text in notepad or whatever text editor you like

I highly reccomend that you decompile your own files using whatever decompiler you personally use for the scripts to decompile and recompile (DRAT, Spiral, Danganronpa Tools etc)
